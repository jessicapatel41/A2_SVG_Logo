# A2_SVG_Logo
Using SVG to construct a logo.

SPECIFICATIONS

The logo consists of a machine-generated SVG <path> to represent simple shapes. This is not ideal. Not only this <path> is difficult to comprehend, but also it makes changes difficult (can you see any other cons?). Consequently, you are asked to re-do the logo using appropriate high-level SVG objects other than <path>s (e.g., <rect>s, <circle>s). Your revised logo should be almost identical to the current logo.

You need to do the logo by hand â€” that is, you are not allowed to use a design tool such as Inkscape.
